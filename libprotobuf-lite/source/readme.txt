I have managed to add the lite version of Google Protocol Buffers as a 3rd party plugin for Airplay. I've attached the zip.

Drop it in \Airplay SDK\4.4\modules\third_party

and add to subprojects like so:

subprojects
{
libprotobuf-lite
}

I use it for a non real time application to send API and data to a Java server hosted on GAE. It's nice to use and faster (supposedly) and more compact datawise than XML.
